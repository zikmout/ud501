Lesson outline

Here's an overview of what you'll learn to do in this lesson. Documentation links are for reference.
Read in multiple stocks:

    Create an empty pandas.DataFrame with dates as index: pandas.date_range
    Drop missing date rows: pandas.DataFrame.dropna
    Incrementally join data for each stock: pandas.DataFrame.join

Manipulate stock data:

    Index and select data by row (dates) and column (symbols)
    Plot multiple stocks at once (still using pandas.DataFrame.plot)
    Carry out arithmetic operations across stocks
